&lt;p&gt;Discovered long time ago, watching sea will makes me feeling calm. Life is a balance of stimulation. Taking rest, is just for having a longer journey. For ages, observing the vastness of the sea has provided me with a profound sense of tranquillity. It seems that life itself thrives on a delicate equilibrium of both invigorating experiences and moments of respite. Taking the time to rest and rejuvenate is not merely a temporary pause, but rather an opportunity to embark on a more enduring and fulfilling journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things I want to do is always overwhelming the time I have. I gradually afraid to do those things, eventually falling into the chaos of pursuing short-term happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what you have forgotten is that, sleeping is the best cure for you.&lt;/p&gt;
